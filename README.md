This script implements a useful function for displaying a list of colleagues who need to be congratulated on their birthday for the week.

If you have a list of users dictionaries, each dictionary in it has keys 'name' and 'birthday' (the structure represents a model of a list of users with their names and birthdays). 'name' is a string with the user's name, and 'birthday' is a datetime object that contains the birthday.

This function receives a list of users as an input and outputs to the console (using print) a list of users who need to be greeted by day.
